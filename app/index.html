        <p>Mira Hair Oil (see “A” in chart) was tested against two other herbal formulations (B and C in chart) in a

            of hair loss.
        </p>

        <p>The oils were tested on 192 adults, male and female who lost 60 hairs or more daily. Researchers measured
            hair density, elasticity, strength, and fragility.</p>

        <p>As the chart shows, the Mira Hair Oil formulation significantly outperformed the other hair oils tested in
            stimulating new hair growth. Specifically, those subjects using Mira Hair Oil experienced 58% new hair
            growth after 8 weeks of use.</p>

        <p>Ffter 8 weeks of use, the Mira Hair Oil reduced hair loss by 75%, cut down on dandruff by 71%, alleviated
            itching by 98%, and increased moisture 133%, which can give hair a shinier and more lustrous look.</p>

        <p>At any one time, your hair is under 3 stages of growth - the <span class="bold">anagen</span>, <span
                class="bold">catagen</span> and <span class="bold">telogen</span> phases. The anagen phase is where all
            the growth of your hair takes place. If your hair is not growing as fast as you’d like, it means that a low
            percentage of your hair is in the anagen phase. This can be caused by a few things:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> You may have too much DHT in your scalp. DHT is a male
                hormone that stops hair growth and causes hair loss by
                choking your hair follicles at the roots causing them to
                eventually fall out.
            </li>

            <li> You don’t have the right circulation of blood to feed your
                growing hair follicles.
            </li>
            <li> Your hair follicles are being plugged and clogged at the
                surface.
            </li>
            <li> You may lack a protein called VEGF, which is a protein
                whose job is to grow healthy, thick hair.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Mira Hair Oil provides your hair with minerals and oils that cure these 4 issues, and increases the
            percentage of hair that is in the anagen phase, causing the hair to start growing at a much faster rate</p>

            Asia sari radix have shown that it is indeed possible to achieve thicker hair, and faster growth through
            more cell division; further studies show that you can also increase the thickness of the hair follicle. Cell
            division is accomplished at the cellular level, and the only way to do this effectively is topically, and
            that is why you need to use an oil like Mira hair oil. It contains herbs like Asia sari radix that will

                proliferation and enhance normal hair growth. In the laboratory, octimum has regrown lost hair in
                cancer-induced rats.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><span class="bold">Citrullus colocynthis</span>: In an animal study published in Natural Product
                Research, a petroleum ether extract of Citrullus colocynthis was shown to promote growth of hair
                follicles just as effectively as the FDA-approved drug Finasteride, only without the side effects.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><span class="bold">Cuscutareflexa</span>: Inhibition of 5alpha-reductase activity by petroleum ether
                extract of Cuscutareflexa suggests that it may reverse androgen-induced alopecia by preventing
                conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) – a hormone that causes hair loss.
            </li>
            <br>


            <li><span class="bold">Eclipta Alba</span> : Also known as Bhringraj (which translates to “king of hair”),
                this plant was demonstrated in a study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology to grow hair in lab
                mice. It can strengthen hair roots, control hair thinning, and prevent premature graying and alopecia.

                growth stage.
            </li>

            <li><span class="bold">Hibiscus</span> : contains calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamin C, vitamin B1, and

            <li><span class="bold">Trigonella</span> : In a 7.5% concentration, trigonella shows excellent hair growth

        <span class="bold">“Half an inch of hair growth monthly”</span> <br>
        “I purchased the Mira Hair Oil because I have brittle bleached blonde hair that was breaking off at the touch,”
        writes Stephanie White, Wasilla, AK. “With the use of Mira Hair Oil every other day, it has made my hair
        stronger, shinier, and silkier to the touch. Mira Hair Oil has restored my natural wave and body. This oil has
        helped me feel better about myself and my hair. I feel less insecure about leaving the house now since using the
        Mira Hair Oil. This is a natural product designed to add life and luster to hair that is over-processed; it has
        helped my scalp heal from the harsh bleaching process. With daily massaging to the scalp, Mira Hair Oil has
        stimulated my hair follicles to grow. I was averaging ¼ of an inch hair growth each month. Now, after using Mira
        Hair Oil, I am at half an inch each month. That is double the growth.</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“All my hair problems stopped”</span> <br>
        “Mira Hair Oil is really amazing,” writes Rosie King, Encino, CA. “From the very first time I started using it,
        my hair texture changed; it is very soft, manageable, and my curls are beautifully defined. I have used it 2 to
        3 times a week for the past 4 months and all my hair problems stopped. My scalp is very clean and healthy, and
        there is a lot of baby hair.</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Hair growth in a month”</span> <br>
        “I was desperate for something that was going to make my hair long, thick, and healthy,” says Melanie Mitchell.
        “I started using Mira Hair Oil every other night, rubbing it into my hair, massaging the scalp for 10 minutes
        before bed. I’ve only been using Mira Hair Oil for a month but I’ve already seen hair growth. I used to have dry
        hair and a dry scalp, and since using Mira Hair Oil my hair has been soft and shiny, and also my scalp has been
        dandruff and itch-free.”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“My hair stopped falling out”</span> <br>
        “I have had serious hair loss for about 3 years, and have spent lots of money on products that have been no
        good,” explains Lladira Garcia, Crescent City, FL. “Then I purchased Mira Hair Oil and was happy for the first
        time. Within 2 weeks, my hair stopped falling out, and I was overjoyed to see that there was no hair left on the
        brush. Now I have long nails, nice skin, thick hair, and I feel great!”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Put almost 3 inches of hair on my head”</span> <br>
        “A few months ago, my hair started to fall out and refused to grow. I was so scared that when I saw your ad, I
        jumped on the offer. After all, with your money-back guarantee, I had nothing to lose. In just 3 months using
        Mira Hair Oil, I have put over 2.8 inches of hair on my head. My hair is long and heavy, and has stopped
        prematurely graying. I don’t know what I would have done without Mira Oil,” says Brenda Willis Leigh Acres FL
        “New growth in thinning areas” - Linda Truesdale, Huntersville, NC.</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“My hair not falling out any more”</span> <br>
        “I have been using Mira Hair Oil for a month now, and what a big difference it has made,” raves Gwen. “My hair
        is so soft and shiny. It is also much more manageable and healthy looking. My hair has grown one inch and has
        not fallen out any more. Mira Hair Oil has given me hair that I’m happy with!”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“1.5 inches of new growth in 4 weeks”</span> <br>
        Christine from the UK says, “After using Mira Hair Oil, I can grow my hair to a reasonable length in a
        relatively short time, because it is looking longer than it ever did during a period of one month’s growth. I
        estimate a growth rate for new hair of about 1 to 1.5 inches over the past 4 weeks.”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Hair fuller and thicker”</span> <br>
        “I got my mom to start using Mira Hair Oil as she has thin hair, and she can already see the results with just 2
        months of use,” says Ross Lives. “Her hair is fuller and thicker and she notices fewer split ends. It even makes
        the hair shine more than ever.”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Grew 1.5 inches in 2 weeks”</span> <br>
        “I bought Mira Hair Oil because I needed for my hair to grow healthy and to stop gray hair,” says Melissa
        Dotson. “After 2 weeks, my hair grew 1.5 inches. I could not believe it!”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“I love my hair again”</span> <br>
        Chris Blake writes: “I have used both the Mira Hair Oil and the Mira Shampoo 4 times now and I swear I’ll never
        use another product on my hair. My hair has that youthful sheen again. It is beautiful. I love my hair again. I
        was even called ‘Hot Momma’ by some stranger at the store.”</p>

        <span class="bold">“2 inches of new growth”</span> <br>
        “I have been using your Mira Hair Oil for over 2 months now and my hair is in the best health it has been since
        I was a teenager,” writes Sharlyn Rakes, Aurora, CO. “I have always had very fine blonde naturally curly hair
        that would consistently break off at the ends and seemed never to grow past my shoulders. After using Mira Hair
        Oil, my hair has grown at least 2 inches already. The new growth is much stronger, thicker, and has more shine
        than ever. I have also noticed that the new growth has no gray!”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Even Harvard couldn’t help me”</span> <br>
        Kerri Chewning says, “I could not wash my hair without noticing a dramatic hair loss. I visited a Harvard
        Medical School licensed dermatologist who could do nothing to help me. When I discovered Mira Hair Oil, I used
        the treatment as prescribed and witnessed a noticeable decrease in hair loss after 2-4 weeks. I also noticed
        baby hair wisps around my forehead, where
        hair had previously receded or fallen out entirely. And the hair I had thickened.”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Doubled in thickness”</span> <br>
        Haelli raves: “I finally have hair now – and a lot of it. My hair has doubled in thickness and has been growing
        fast since I started to use Mira Hair Oil. Even the patches of loss have started to appear after being
        stubborn.”</p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">“Hair grows faster”</span> <br>

        “Mira Hair Oil will change your hair,” raves Rebecca Wheeler, Darwin, Australia. “It will become super shiny,
        bouncy, and thick. Your color will be brighter, your hair will be easier to manage, and it will grow faster.
        Mira Hair Oil does everything it promises! I will never be without it.”</p>
